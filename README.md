## VBWINSOCKSERVER


</div>

### Description

This code will help people understand using winsock control to run a Vb server.

This Code comes with both a server code and client code. It uses string manipulation to sort the data and also uses what i like to call bit divide. which i have included its own project to help users understand the process.
 
### More Info
 
Know that the client port needs to match the server port in order to connect also, when users are running firewalls you need to open a port range say from starting port to starting port + 500 (max users)

so if the server was running on port 2600 you would open the range from 2600 to 3100 on your firewall.
